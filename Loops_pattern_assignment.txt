JS assignment on nested loops, write using the function which brings modularity in the code

1) write a program to display the following pattern
   *
   * *
   * * *
   * * * *
   and also write to display
   + + + + +
   - - - -
   + + +
   - -
   +
2) Display the following pattern
   10
   11 12
   13 14 15
   16 17 18 19

   and also write to display  

   75 74 73 72 71
   70 69 68 67
   66 65 64
   63 62
   61

3) find all the prime numbers in the range of 100 to 700
   stop  processing the number range,
   the moment your prime number count reaches 10  
   if the count is not reached 10 then continue processing the range 
   of the number.

4) given  var a = [15,14,18,20,8,25,199,200,55,45,3,200]
   find how many numbers are multiples of 5 as well as 8
   how many numbers are perfect square 
   (example of perfect square is 16 which is 4x4 or 25 which is 5x5 etc)
   sort the array (not using the built-in method) and display the sorted array  (you could try bubble sort)

5)  reverse a number (say) var a= 16789
    output should be 98761
    find out during reversing how many digits repeat
    (use switch case)
    for example if the var b = 5655677885
    reverse is 5887765565
    count of 5 is 4
    count of 8 is 2
    count of 7 is 2
    count of 6 is 2
    and so on
6) var a = 125
   convert it to binary and display
   the output is 1111101
