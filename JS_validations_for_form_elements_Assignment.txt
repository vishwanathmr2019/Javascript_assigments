Assignment with HTML,CSS and form validation 
=============================================
For all the 3 problems. design a user friendly form with css and then infuse the JS code
You must handle error handling using try, catch, finally appropriately.


1)  Input 2 numbers in a text box
    Have another box for holding the result (non-editable)
	Have 5 button with names as '+', '-', '*' , '/' '%'
	On click of '+'
	the number from the text box1 and text box2 should be processed to give the result and placed in the third text box
    
    Note : you must handle divide by 0 error meaning if the text box1 has 10 and text box2 is 0 and on click of '/'	it should say 'Divide by 0 is not allowed'.

Functionality should be added for -, * and %

2)  Enter a string in a text box. have another text box below it. the other text box is going to hold the result of the following activity done.
    Have 5 Radio button options like this 
	 opt1: Convert to lower case
	 opt2: Convert to upper case
	 opt3: Count how many vowels are there in the string in text box
	 opt4: On click of this option all 'j', 'r' and 's' - in the string should be removed
	      suppose the string was:: 
hello all ravi , sanjay and jayanth are my friends
	  then j,r,s char are removed to result into
	  hello all avi , anay and ayanth ae my fiends
	 opt5: On click of this compare the exact content of the string with a given array 
var ctr[] = "Nepal","India","Germany","Brazil","Mexico","Japan","Korea"]
  it should check whether the contents in the text box1 matches any array element  and display in the text box2 "country matches" OR "no country match"
		  
     Remember that on click of the radio button the output/result would have to go to another text box2

3)  Date Validation
    Day: Text box 1
    Month : Text box 2
    Year:  Text box 3 
	
Have a button 'Validate', on click of that it take the inputted data from all the 
	3 text boxes and checks whether the date is valid or not
	and display the message 'Valid date' OR 'Invalid date' in the text box
If the user enters say A100 in text box1 or 2 or 3 handle error
